## An effort to make updating the zibomod for X-Plane easier to keep up with.

Since the mod is primarily focused on the Windows OS, this app is currently only available for Windows. 
If there's a need for a version dedicated to another OS then that is fully possible, since this app is cross-platform.

## Install
### The app comes with an easy-to-use installer. Just choose a location and you're done!
## Usage
The app requires the path to your installation of the zibomod. It also requires a download folder, which is set to the users default download folder if not set by the user.
The user interface will then provide you with a few options:

|Name|Function  |
|--|--|
|Download  |This button downloads all available (visible on screen) updates to the download directory. Progress will be shown using a green bar, for smaller updates this takes about 2-3 seconds.  |
|Manual|This also downloads the update, however by manual selection in case you'd want to have more control.
|Update|This button installs all downloaded updates in order. Progress will be shown using a blue bar and will have finished once the whole bar turns solid blue. Once all updates are done, a check will be performed to make sure that a new version was installed successfully and then the list will be cleared of installed updates.|
Donate|A direct link to my PayPal donate page. Countless of hours and sleepless nights were put into this and I'd really appreciate it if you'd buy me some coffee!

## Features to come
